Indicate the condition ratings
================

The conditions in the items 58, 59, 60, 61, and 62, have specific
definitions that specify which classification they belong to. The item
BRIDGE\_CONDITION is based on the lowest ratings of these values, if the
lowest rating is greater than or equal to 7, the bridge is classified as
“Good”; if it is less than or equal to 4, the classification is “Poor”.
Bridges rated 5 or 6 are classified as “Fair”.

## Items 58, 59, and 60 guide:

-   N / Not applicable - The structure does not contain this part, items
    should be coded as not applicable if structure contains a culvert.
-   9 / Excellent condition - No problems or visual markings seen.
-   8 / Very good condition - No problems noted.
-   7 / Good condition - Some minor problems.
-   6 / Satisfactory condition - Structural elements show some minor
    deterioration.
-   5 / Fair condition - All primary structural elements are sound but
    may have minor section loss, cracking, spalling or scour.
-   4 / Poor condition - Advanced section loss, deterioration, spalling
    or scour.
-   3 / Serious condition - Loss of section, deterioration, spalling or
    scour have seriously affected primary structural components. Local
    failures are possible. Fatigue cracks in steel or shear cracks in
    concrete may be present.
-   2 / Critical condition - Advanced deterioration of primary
    structural elements. Fatigue cracks in steel or shear cracks in
    concrete may be present or scour may have removed substructure
    support. Unless closely monitored it may be necessary to close the
    bridge until corrective action is taken.
-   1 / “Imminent” failure condition - Major deterioration or section
    loss present in critical structural components or obvious vertical
    or horizontal movement affecting structure stability. Bridge is
    closed to traffic but corrective action may put back in light
    service.
-   0 / Failed condition - Out of service - beyond corrective action.

## Item 61 guide:

-   N / Not applicable - Not applicable. Use when bridge is not over a
    waterway (channel).
-   9 / Excellent condition - There are no noticeable or noteworthy
    deficiencies which affect the condition of the channel.
-   8 / Very good condition - Banks are protected or well vegetated.
    River control devices such as spur dikes and embankment protection
    are not required or are in a stable condition.
-   7 / Good condition - Bank protection is in need of minor repairs.
    River control devices and embankment protection have a little minor
    damage. Banks and/or channel have minor amounts of drift.
-   6 / Satisfactory condition - Bank is beginning to slump. River
    control devices and embankment protection have widespread minor
    damage. There is minor stream bed movement evident. Debris is
    restricting the channel slightly.
-   5 / Fair condition - Bank protection is being eroded. River control
    devices and/or embankment have major damage. Trees and brush
    restrict the channel.
-   4 / Poor condition - Bank and embankment protection is severely
    undermined. River control devices have severe damage. Large deposits
    of debris are in the channel.
-   3 / Serious condition - Bank protection has failed. River control
    devices have been destroyed. Stream bed aggradation, degradation or
    lateral movement has changed the channel to now threaten the bridge
    and/or approach roadway.
-   2 / Critical condition - The channel has changed to the extent the
    bridge is near a state of collapse.
-   1 / Closed, Repairable - Bridge closed because of channel failure.
    Corrective action may put back in light service.
-   0 / Closed, Replacement Necessary - Bridge closed because of channel
    failure. Replacement necessary.

## Item 62 guide:

-   N / Not applicable - Not applicable. Use if structure is not a
    culvert.
-   9 / Excellent condition - No deficiencies.
-   8 / Very good condition - No noticeable or noteworthy deficiencies
    which affect the condition of the culvert. Insignificant scrape
    marks caused by drift.
-   7 / Good condition - Shrinkage cracks, light scaling, and
    insignificant spalling which does not expose reinforcing steel.
    Insignificant damage caused by drift with no misalignment and not
    requiring corrective action. Some minor scouring has occurred near
    curtain walls, wingwalls, or pipes. Metal culverts have a smooth
    symmetrical curvature with superficial corrosion and no pitting.
-   6 / Satisfactory condition - Deterioration or initial
    disintegration, minor chloride contamination, cracking with some
    leaching, or spalls on concrete or masonry walls and slabs. Local
    minor scouring at curtain walls, wingwalls, or pipes. Metal culverts
    have a smooth curvature, non-symmetrical shape, significant
    corrosion or moderate pitting.
-   5 / Fair condition - Moderate to major deterioration or
    disintegration, extensive cracking and leaching, or spalls on
    concrete or masonry walls and slabs. Minor settlement or
    misalignment. Noticeable scouring or erosion at curtain walls,
    wingwalls, or pipes. Metal culverts have significant distortion and
    deflection in one section, significant corrosion or deep pitting.
-   4 / Poor condition - Large spalls, heavy scaling, wide cracks,
    considerable efflorescence, or opened construction joint permitting
    loss of backfill. Considerable settlement or misalignment.
    Considerable scouring or erosion at curtain walls, wingwalls or
    pipes. Metal culverts have significant distortion and deflection
    throughout, extensive corrosion or deep pitting.
-   3 / Serious condition - Any condition described in Code 4 but which
    is excessive in scope. Severe movement or differential settlement of
    the segments, or loss of fill. Holes may exist in walls or slabs.
    Integral wingwalls nearly severed from culvert. Severe scour or
    erosion at curtain walls, wingwalls or pipes. Metal culverts have
    extreme distortion and deflection in one section, extensive
    corrosion, or deep pitting with scattered perforations.
-   2 / Critical condition - Integral wingwalls collapsed, severe
    settlement of roadway due to loss of fill. Section of culvert may
    have failed and can no longer support embankment. Complete
    undermining at curtain walls and pipes. Corrective action required
    to maintain traffic. Metal culverts have extreme distortion and
    deflection throughout with extensive perforations due to corrosion.
-   1 / Closed, Repairable - Bridge closed. Corrective action may put
    back in light service.
-   0 / Closed, Replacement Necessary - Bridge closed. Replacement
    necessary.
